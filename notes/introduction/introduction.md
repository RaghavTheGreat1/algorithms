# Algorithms


## What is an Algorithm?

An Algorithm is a step-by-step unambiguous instruction to solve a given problem and obtain a legitimate output in a finite time.

Just like a recipe in cooking, it tells your computer exactly what steps it needs to take to arrive at the desired result.

In programming and algorithms, non-ambiguity means the instructions or steps are clear, precise, and unambiguous. Each instruction has exactly one meaning and leaves no room for misinterpretation.
